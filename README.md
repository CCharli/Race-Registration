# Race-Registration
This provides the basic framework for efficiently registering runners into a hypothetical racing event!

This project imagines a scenario in which a race event needs to quickly and painlessly register adults and children to participate.

Registration stipulations are as follows:

i) Adults (18+ years) who register early recieve a race number greater than 1000 and race at time 0930.

ii) Adults who register late recieve a race number less than 1000 and race at time 1100.

iii) Children (18- years) recieve a race number less than 1000 and race at time 1230 regardless of registration time.

iv) Runners who are exactly 18 years old must contact the registration desk to proceed.
